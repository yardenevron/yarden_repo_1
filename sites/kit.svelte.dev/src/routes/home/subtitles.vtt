00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
 [Scott Tolinski] I wanted to share it immediately.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.240
 I wanted to build more things in it.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.640
 [James Q Quick] I love it.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.080
 [Fireship] It's the only JavaScript framework

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.640
 that's actually enjoyable to use.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.540
 [Ben McCann] Svelte introduced a new ergonomics

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.160
 to building a website that's made it more fun

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.440
 and easier than it's been in a long time.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.720
 And the way that it's done that is by introducing

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.360
 this concept of generating reactive code at compile time.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.560
 [Scott Tolinski] What Svelte allows us to do is to write code

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.400
 that's not only small and simple, but plain and readable.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.760
 [Amelia Wattenberger] You're mostly just looking at basic HTML,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.760
 JavaScript, and CSS.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.120
 [Aliza Aufrichtig] The thing I like most about using Svelte

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.200
 is how fast you can move.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.400
 [Moritz Stefaner] And when I discovered Svelte, it came back to this,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.800
 oh, here's a really simple way to do things.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.480
 [Shawn Wang] You don't actually need all this machinery

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.120
 in order to do components right.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.640
 I looked at my React experience so far â€”

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.120
 I could not be anywhere as productive as I could be in Svelte.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.520
 And that's when it started really taking it seriously.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.800
 [Amelia Wattenberger] There's quite a bit of usage these days

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.680
 and satisfaction is still, I think, the highest

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.920
 or one of the highest for any of the larger

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.120
 or more used JavaScript frameworks.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.040
 [Guillermo Rauch] When you write your application,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.160
 you're making it fast by construction.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.880
 It's almost impossible to create a slow app

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.200
 and I think Svelte has an incredible advantage here.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.360
 People love Svelte.
